OG-IMAGE CREATION GUIDE
========================

To create a proper og-image.jpg (1200x630 pixels) for link previews:

1. RECOMMENDED TOOLS:
   - Canva (easy, drag-and-drop)
   - Figma (professional design)
   - Adobe Photoshop/Illustrator
   - GIMP (free alternative)

2. DESIGN SPECIFICATIONS:
   - Dimensions: 1200x630 pixels (1.91:1 aspect ratio)
   - Format: JPG (RGB color space)
   - File size: Under 5MB (preferably under 1MB)
   - Background: Use brand colors (indigo/purple gradient like the app)
   - Text: "SnapifY - Event Sharing Platform"
   - Include: Camera, sharing, or event-related icons

3. CONTENT IDEAS:
   - App logo/branding
   - Sample event photos
   - "Share Your Moments" or "Capture Every Memory"
   - QR code or sharing icons
